@article{Lister2014,
abstract = {Background: Gamification has been a predominant focus of the health app industry in recent years. However, to our knowledge, there has yet to be a review of gamification elements in relation to health behavior constructs, or insight into the true proliferation of gamification in health apps. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the extent to which gamification is used in health apps, and analyze gamification of health and fitness apps as a potential component of influence on a consumer{\&}{\#}8217;s health behavior. Methods: An analysis of health and fitness apps related to physical activity and diet was conducted among apps in the Apple App Store in the winter of 2014. This analysis reviewed a sample of 132 apps for the 10 effective game elements, the 6 core components of health gamification, and 13 core health behavior constructs. A regression analysis was conducted in order to measure the correlation between health behavior constructs, gamification components, and effective game elements. Results: This review of the most popular apps showed widespread use of gamification principles, but low adherence to any professional guidelines or industry standard. Regression analysis showed that game elements were associated with gamification ( P {\&}{\#}60;.001). Behavioral theory was associated with gamification ( P {\&}{\#}60;.05), but not game elements, and upon further analysis gamification was only associated with composite motivational behavior scores ( P {\&}{\#}60;.001), and not capacity or opportunity/trigger. Conclusions: This research, to our knowledge, represents the first comprehensive review of gamification use in health and fitness apps, and the potential to impact health behavior. The results show that use of gamification in health and fitness apps has become immensely popular, as evidenced by the number of apps found in the Apple App Store containing at least some components of gamification. This shows a lack of integrating important elements of behavioral theory from the app industry, which can potentially impact the efficacy of gamification apps to change behavior. Apps represent a very promising, burgeoning market and landscape in which to disseminate health behavior change interventions. Initial results show an abundant use of gamification in health and fitness apps, which necessitates the in-depth study and evaluation of the potential of gamification to change health behaviors.

By optimizing near-infrared optical-interference, we demonstrate power efficiencies of 1.3±0.1{\%} with simultaneous average visible transmission of {\textgreater}65{\%}. Subsequent incorporation of near-infrared distributed-Bragg-reflector mirrors leads to an increase in the efficiency to 1.7±0.1{\%}, approaching the 2.4±0.2{\%} efficiency of the opaque cell, while maintaining high visible-transparency of {\textgreater}55{\%}. Finally, we demonstrate that a series-integrated array of these transparent cells is capable of powering electronic devices under near-ambient lighting. This architecture suggests strategies for high-efficiency power-generating windows and highlights an application uniquely benefiting from excitonic electronics.},

@article{Kautiainen2005,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased among children and adolescents, as well as among adults, and television viewing has been suggested as one cause. Playing digital games (video, computer and console games), or using computer may be other sedentary behaviors related to the development of overweight and obesity. OBJECTIVE: To study the relationships of times spent on viewing television, playing digital games and using computer to overweight among Finnish adolescents. DESIGN: Mailed cross-sectional survey. SUBJECTS: Nationally representative samples of 14-, 16-, and 18-y-old (N=6515, response rate 70{\%}) in 2001. METHODS: Overweight and obesity were assessed by body mass index (BMI). The respondents reported times spent daily on viewing television, playing digital games (video, computer and console games) and using computer (for e-mail, writing and surfing). Data on timing of biological maturation, intensity of weekly physical activity and family's socio economic status were taken into account in the statistical analyses. RESULTS: Increased times spent on viewing television and using computer were associated with increased prevalence of overweight (obesity inclusive) among girls: compared to girls viewing television {\textless}1 h daily, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for being overweight was 1.4 when spending 1-3 h, and 2.0 when spending {\textgreater} or =4 h daily on viewing television. In girls using computer {\textgreater} or =1 h daily, the OR for being overweight was 1.5 compared to girls using computer {\textless}1 h daily. The results were similar in boys, although not statistically significant. Time spent on playing digital games was not associated with overweight. CONCLUSION: Overweight was associated with using information and communication technology (ICT), but only with certain forms of ICT. Increased use of ICT may be one factor explaining the increased prevalence of overweight and obesity at the population level, at least in girls. Playing digital games was not related to overweight, perhaps by virtue of game playing being less sedentary or related to a different lifestyle than viewing television and using computer.},

@article{Dong,
abstract = {—In wireless sensor networks, nodes can be static or mobile, depending on the application requirements. Dealing with mobility can pose some formidable challenges in protocol design, particularly, at the link and network layers. These difficulties require mobility adaption algorithms to efficiently localize mobile nodes and predict the quality of link that can be established with these nodes. An off the shelf development platform that uses Radio Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) is mostly selected as the sensor localization method, especially in the indoor environment. Despite this, not much research work has been done to practically demonstrate the reliability of RSSI for indoor localization. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to calibrate and map RSSI to distance by doing a series of experiments. The result shows that the RSSI technology gives an unacceptable high error and thus is not reliable for the indoor sensor localization.},
