\chapter{Design}

\section{Overview}

The project can be split into two main sections -- the front-end mobile application and the back-end server to store data and communicate with the mobile app.

These two sections link together very closely and are both required to produce a working implementation. It is therefore extremely important to not only consider the design of the user interface but also more technical aspects, such as the way the user's data is stored in the database and how the API will communicate with the mobile app.

\section{Technologies}

The first part of the design of the project is to consider which technologies to use. The technologies that I chose stemmed either from the background research I conducted in the previous section or previous personal knowledge.

%\subsection{Mobile Operating System}

% move section in background to here?

\subsection{Third-party APIs}

As discussed in Section \ref{subsection:background-apis}, Apple Maps is much more integrated with the Core Location framework in iOS, which makes it easier to display a user's location on a map.


\subsection{Back-end Language}

\subsection{Database}

\subsection{API Deployment}


\section{User Interface Design}

% design of app
% how screens are organised
% survey

\section{API Design}

% REST model, specific endpoints, etc.

\subsection{Database Design}

% types of models â€“ user, walk, invite, etc.
